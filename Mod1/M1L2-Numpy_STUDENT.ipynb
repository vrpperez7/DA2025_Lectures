    "\n",
    "Imagine you're analyzing basketball player statistics. Each player has several stats, such as points scored, rebounds, and assists. You'll use NumPy to store and manipulate this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create and manipulate NumPy arrays.\n",
    "2. Work with multidimensional arrays (players as rows, stats as columns).\n",
    "3. Perform mathematical operations on arrays.\n",
    "4. Transpose arrays and understand their significance.\n",
    "5. Learn about correlation and calculate it using NumPy."
